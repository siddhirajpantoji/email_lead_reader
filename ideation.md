# 🧠 Ideation Document: Email Lead Extractor

## 📌 Title of Idea

**Email Lead Extractor**
A simple automation tool that helps businesses extract and organize leads directly from their inbox.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

We receive potential customer leads directly through email. However, identifying, filtering, and organizing these leads manually is time-consuming and inefficient. Important leads can be easily missed, especially when the inbox is cluttered.

This causes:

* Loss of potential customers
* Delays in follow-up communication
* Poor or no integration with CRM systems

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The solution is a Python-based script that automatically:

* Connects to your Gmail inbox via IMAP securely
* Searches for emails containing lead-related content using pre-defined keywords
* Extracts important contact information like phone numbers and email addresses
* Stores the information into a structured CSV file or optionally into a Google Sheet

This tool provides a hands-free experience for converting unstructured email data into structured, actionable sales leads.

---

## 👥 Target Audience

This script is designed for:

* Freelancers and consultants who receive client inquiries via email
* Small and medium-sized businesses without advanced CRM systems
* Marketing and sales teams that want to automate lead organization
* CRM administrators looking for lightweight integrations

---

## 🛠️ Core Features

* **Secure IMAP access** to Gmail using `.env`-protected credentials
* **Keyword-based lead detection** from email subject and body
* **Extraction of phone numbers and email addresses** using pattern matching
* **CSV file output** for easy access and CRM compatibility
* Lightweight, modular, and easily customizable

---

## 🧪 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP version of this script includes:

* Reading 20 unread emails from the Gmail inbox
* Filtering them using predefined keywords like “lead”, “inquiry”, “requirement”
* Extracting any email addresses or phone numbers present
* Writing the results to a CSV file named `leads.csv`
